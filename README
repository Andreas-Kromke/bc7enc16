bc7enc16 - Fast, single source file BC7/BPTC GPU texture encoder with perceptual colorspace metric support

<work in progress - only tested under Windows with VS2015 x64 so far>

Supports modes 1 and 6. This is a strong opaque texture encoder, with basic
support for alpha channels (using mode 6). The intended use case is opaque
textures, or opaque textures with relatively simple alpha channels.

If alpha is highly correlated compared to RGB, or it's relatively simple (think
straightforward masks where lots of blocks are either all-transparent or
all-opaque), it should work great. For complex alpha channels more modes (such
as 4, 5 or maybe 7) are necessary. 

Why only modes 1 and 6?
Because with these two modes you have a complete encoder that supports both
opaque and transparent textures in a small amount (~1400 lines) of
understandable plain C code. Mode 6 excels on smooth blocks, and mode 1 is
strong with complex blocks, and an encoder that fully exploits both modes can be
quite high quality. Fast mode 6-only encoders will have noticeable block
artifacts, which this codec avoids by fully supporting mode 1.

Modes 1 and 6 are typically the most used modes on many textures using other
encoders. Mode 1 has two subsets, 64 possible partitions, and 3-bit indices,
while mode 6 has large 4-bit indices and high precision 7777.1 endpoints. This
codec produces output that is far higher quality than any BC1 encoder, and
approaches (or in perceptual mode exceeds!) the quality of other full BC7
encoders.

This was a multithreaded benchmark (using OpenMP) on a dual Xeon workstation.
ispc_texcomp was called with 64-blocks at a time. Timings are for encoding time
only.
