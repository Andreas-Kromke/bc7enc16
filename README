bc7enc16 - Fast, single source file BC7/BPTC GPU texture encoder with perceptual colorspace metric support

<work in progress - only tested under Windows with VS2015 so far>

Supports modes 1 and 6. This is a strong opaque texture encoder, with basic
support for alpha channels (using mode 6). If alpha is highly correlated
compared to RGB, or it's relatively simple (think straightforward masks where
lots of blocks are either all-transparent or all-opaque), it should work great.
For complex alpha channels more modes (such as 4,5 or maybe 7) are necessary.
